# Welcome

Welcome to Swedish Language Resources_.  This interactive document
is an evolving work that collects resources for English speakers
who are learning the Swedish language.  I started this when I was
working through the Swedish language course on
[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/course/sv/en/Learn-Swedish).
The Wordpress site where it was originally hosted suffered from
some bitrot, so I moved it over to a nice fresh
[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) site.

## Background

Back in 2015, I started learning [Danish](/dansk) via
[Duolingo](http://duolingo.com).  After several months, I completed
the Danish course and wanted to keep up my consecutive days streak.
Because it was amusing, I decided to continue with the Swedish
language course, because, well, why not, that's why.  The language
is itself similar to Danish, as both are [North Germanic
languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Germanic_languages).  I
found the Swedish course to be much easier than Danish, mostly
because those built-in similarities.

This page exists to collect resources from around the Internet,
principally YouTube, to help students learning Danish and provide
a catalog for my own use.  Please feel free to suggest additional
material.
